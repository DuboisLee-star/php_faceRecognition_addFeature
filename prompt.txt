This is the php built site registration page code to add a new member in 'tab_membros' table.
In this page, there's already constructed to upload photo using webcam installed on pc.
Using this code style and basis, i need to make a page to update the photo fo the specified member or add one if not have photo.
In the page, There's search option to find members in 'tab_membros' and i select him.
and using the same model in the prior code, upload photo using webcam.
and using save or update button. Update the the photo to 'tab_membros'.
The data saving module and logic is the same with the prior code.
Using the same page style.
